# About Project :
   **Project Title** : **Multi Region Sales Analysis Dashboard**


A Multinational Consumer Electronics Company headquartered at Dubai has 5 Sales
Representatives working across India and 4 regional managers (responsible for region
wise Business development), one for each region. The company has customers in all 4
regions of the country- East, West, North, South. All the five Sales representatives in
India report to all the regional managers and the regional managers report to the Asia
Sales Manager based out of Singapore,so I Created a Sales Dashboard that will enable the
Asia Sales Manager to effectively track the Business in India at a glance.

The excel document has data generated by the regional sales managers for their
respective regions in different sheets. 
I  analyze the data and created effective visualizations.

In order to create the slicers we  need Microsoft Excel 2013 or Higher version
installed. Please ensure this for smooth completion of Project.
